                <p>Father of the Nation Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s achievement as the founder of Pakistan,
                    dominates everything else he did in his long and crowded public life spanning some 42 years. Yet, by
                    any standard, his was an eventful life, his personality multidimensional and his achievements in
                    other fields were many, if not equally great. Indeed, several were the roles he had played with
                    distinction: at one time or another, he was one of the greatest legal luminaries India had produced
                    during the first half of the century, an `ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity, a great
                    constitutionalist, a distinguished parliamentarian, a top-notch politician, an indefatigable
                    freedom-fighter, a dynamic Muslim leader, a political strategist and, above all one of the great
                    nation-builders of modern times. What, however, makes him so remarkable is the fact that while
                    similar other leaders assumed the leadership of traditionally well-defined nations and espoused
                    their cause, or led them to freedom, he created a nation out of an inchoate and down-trodden
                    minority and established a cultural and national home for it. And all that within a decade. For over
                    three decades before the successful culmination in 1947, of the Muslim struggle for freedom in the
                    South-Asian subcontinent, Jinnah had provided political leadership to the Indian Muslims: initially
                    as one of the leaders, but later, since 1947, as the only prominent leader- the Quaid-e-Azam.

                    For over thirty years, he had guided their affairs; he had given expression, coherence and direction
                    to their legitimate aspirations and cherished dreams; he had formulated these into concrete demands;
                    and, above all, he had striven all the while to get them conceded by both the ruling British and the
                    numerous Hindus the dominant segment of India’s population. And for over thirty years he had fought,
                    relentlessly and inexorably, for the inherent rights of the Muslims for an honorable existence in
                    the subcontinent. Indeed, his life story constitutes, as it were, the story of the rebirth of the
                    Muslims of the subcontinent and their spectacular rise to nationhood, phoenixlike.

            <h2>EARLY LIFE</h2>
            <p>
                Born on December 25, 1876, in a prominent mercantile family in Karachi and educated at the Sindh
                Madrassat-ul-Islam and the Christian Mission School at his birth place, Jinnah joined the Lincoln’s Inn
                in 1893 to become the youngest Indian to be called to the Bar, three years later. Starting out in the
                legal profession with nothing to fall back upon except his native ability and determination, young
                Jinnah rose to prominence and became Bombay’s most successful lawyer, as few did, within a few years.
                Once he was firmly established in the legal profession, Jinnah formally entered politics in 1905 from
                the platform of the Indian National Congress. He went to England in that year along with Gopal Krishna
                Gokhale (1866-1915), as a member of a Congress delegation to plead the cause of Indian self-government
                during the British elections. A year later, he served as Secretary to Dadabhai Noaroji (1825-1917), the
                then Indian National Congress President, which was considered a great honor for a budding politician.
                Here, at the Calcutta Congress session (December 1906), he also made his first political speech in
                support of the resolution on self-government.
            </p>
            <h2>POLITICAL CAREER</h2>
            <p>Three years later, in January 1910, Jinnah was elected to the newly-constituted Imperial Legislative
                Council. All through his parliamentary career, which spanned some four decades, he was probably the most
                powerful voice in the cause of Indian freedom and Indian rights. Jinnah, who was also the first Indian
                to pilot a private member’s Bill through the Council, soon became a leader of a group inside the
                legislature. Mr. Montagu (1879-1924), Secretary of State for India, at the close of the First World War,
                considered Jinnah “perfect mannered, impressive-looking, armed to the teeth with dialectics…”Jinnah, he
                felt, “is a very clever man, and it is, of course, an outrage that such a man should have no chance of
                running the affairs of his own country.”</p>
            <p>For about three decades since his entry into politics in 1906, Jinnah passionately believed in and
                assiduously worked for Hindu-Muslim unity. Gokhale, the foremost Hindu leader before Gandhi, had once
                said of him, “He has the true stuff in him and that freedom from all sectarian prejudice which will make
                him the best ambassador of Hindu-Muslim Unity: And, to be sure, he did become the architect of
                Hindu-Muslim Unity: he was responsible for the Congress-League Pact of 1916, known popularly as Luck now
                Pact- the only pact ever signed between the two political organizations, the Congress and the All-India
                Muslim League, representing, as they did, the two major communities in the subcontinent.</p>
            <p>The Congress-League scheme embodied in this pact was to become the basis for the Montagu-Chemlsford
                Reforms, also known as the Act of 1919. In retrospect, the Luckhnow Pact represented a milestone in the
                evolution of Indian politics. For one thing, it conceded Muslims the right to separate electorate,
                reservation of seats in the legislatures and weightage in representation both at the Centre and the
                minority provinces. Thus, their retention was ensured in the next phase of reforms. For another, it
                represented a tacit recognition of the All-India Muslim League as the representative organization of the
                Muslims, thus strengthening the trend towards Muslim individuality in Indian politics. And to Jinnah
                goes the credit for all this. Thus, by 1917, Jinnah came to be recognized among both Hindus and Muslims
                as one of India’s most outstanding political leaders. Not only was he prominent in the Congress and the
                Imperial Legislative Council, he was also the President of the All-India Muslim League and that of the
                Bombay Branch of the Home Rule League. More importantly, because of his key-role in the Congress-League
                entente at Luckhnow, he was hailed as the ambassador, of Hindu-Muslim unity.</p>
            <h2>CONSTITUTIONAL STRUGGLE</h2>
            <p>In subsequent years, however, he felt dismayed at the injection of violence into politics. Since Jinnah
                stood for “ordered progress”, moderation, gradualism and constitutionalism, he felt that political
                violence was not the pathway to national liberation but, the dark alley to disaster and destruction.

            </p>
            <p>In the ever-growing frustration among the masses caused by colonial rule, there was ample cause for
                extremism. But, Gandhi’s doctrine of non-cooperation, Jinnah felt, even as Rabindranath
                Tagore(1861-1941) did also feel, was at best one of negation and despair: it might lead to the building
                up of resentment, but nothing constructive. Hence, he opposed tooth and nail the tactics adopted by
                Gandhi to exploit the Khilafat and wrongful tactics in the Punjab in the early twenties. On the eve of
                its adoption of the Gandhian programmed, Jinnah warned the Nagpur Congress Session (1920): “you are
                making a declaration (of Swaraj within a year) and committing the Indian National Congress to a
                programme, which you will not be able to carry out”. He felt that there was no short-cut to independence
                and that any extra-constitutional methods could only lead to political violence, lawlessness and chaos,
                without bringing India nearer to the threshold of freedom.</p>
            <p>The future course of events was not only to confirm Jinnah’s worst fears, but also to prove him right.
                Although Jinnah left the Congress soon thereafter, he continued his efforts towards bringing about a
                Hindu-Muslim entente, which he rightly considered “the most vital condition of Swaraj”. However, because
                of the deep distrust between the two communities as evidenced by the country-wide communal riots, and
                because the Hindus failed to meet the genuine demands of the Muslims, his efforts came to naught. One
                such effort was the formulation of the Delhi Muslim Proposals in March, 1927. In order to bridge
                Hindu-Muslim differences on the constitutional plan, these proposals even waived the Muslim right to
                separate electorate, the most basic Muslim demand since 1906, which though recognized by the Congress in
                the Luckhnow Pact, had again become a source of friction between the two communities. surprisingly
                though, the Nehru Report (1928), which represented the Congress-sponsored proposals for the future
                constitution of India, negated the minimum Muslim demands embodied in the Delhi Muslim Proposals.</p>
            <h2>MUSLIM LEAGUE REORGANIZED</h2>
            <p>Thus, the task that awaited Jinnah was anything but easy. The Muslim League was dormant: even its
                provincial organizations were, for the most part, ineffective and only nominally under the control of
                the central organization. Nor did the central body have any coherent policy of its own till the Bombay
                session (1936), which Jinnah organized. To make matters worse, the provincial scene presented a sort of
                a jigsaw puzzle: in the Punjab, Bengal, Sindh, the North West Frontier, Assam, Bihar and the United
                Provinces, various Muslim leaders had set up their own provincial parties to serve their personal ends.
                Extremely frustrating as the situation was, the only consolation Jinnah had at this juncture was in
                Allama Iqbal (1877-1938), the poet-philosopher, who stood steadfast by him and helped to chart the
                course of Indian politics from behind the scene.</p>
            <p>Undismayed by this bleak situation, Jinnah devoted himself to the sole purpose of organizing the Muslims
                on one platform. He embarked upon country-wide tours. He pleaded with provincial Muslim leaders to sink
                their differences and make common cause with the League. He exhorted the Muslim masses to organize
                themselves and join the League. He gave coherence and direction to Muslim sentiments on the Government
                of India Act, 1935. He advocated that the Federal Scheme should be scrapped as it was subversive of
                India’s cherished goal of complete responsible Government, while the provincial scheme, which conceded
                provincial autonomy for the first time, should be worked for what it was worth, despite its certain
                objectionable features. He also formulated a viable League manifesto for the election scheduled for
                early 1937. He was, it seemed, struggling against time to make Muslim India a power to be reckoned with.
            </p>
            <h2>THE NEW AWAKENING</h2>
            <p>As a result of Jinnah’s ceaseless efforts, the Muslims awakened from what Professor Baker calls (their)
                “unreflective silence” (in which they had so complacently basked for long decades), and to “the
                spiritual essence of nationality” that had existed among them for a pretty long time. Roused by the
                impact of successive Congress hammerings, the Muslims, as Ambedkar (principal author of independent
                India’s Constitution) says, “searched their social consciousness in a desperate attempt to find coherent
                and meaningful articulation to their cherished yearnings. To their great relief, they discovered that
                their sentiments of nationality had flamed into nationalism”. In addition, not only had they developed”
                the will to live as a “nation”, had also endowed them with a territory which they could occupy and make
                a State as well as a cultural home for the newly discovered nation. These two pre-requisites provided
                the Muslims with the intellectual justification for claiming a distinct nationalism (apart from Indian
                or Hindu nationalism) for themselves. So that when, after their long pause, the Muslims gave expression
                to their innermost yearnings, these turned out to be in favour of a separate Muslim nationhood and of a
                separate Muslim state.</p>
            <h2>DEMAND FOR PAKISTAN</h2>
            <p>“We are a nation”, they claimed in the ever eloquent words of the Quaid-i-Azam- “We are a nation with our
                own distinctive culture and civilization, language and literature, art and architecture, names and
                nomenclature, sense of values and proportion, legal laws and moral code, customs and calendar, history
                and tradition, aptitudes and ambitions; in short, we have our own distinctive outlook on life and of
                life. By all canons of international law, we are a nation”. The formulation of the Muslim demand for
                Pakistan in 1940 had a tremendous impact on the nature and course of Indian politics. On the one hand,
                it shattered for ever the Hindu dreams of a pseudo-Indian, in fact, Hindu empire on British exit from
                India: on the other, it heralded an era of Islamic renaissance and creativity in which the Indian
                Muslims were to be active participants. The Hindu reaction was quick, bitter, and malicious.</p>
            <p>Equally hostile were the British to the Muslim demand, their hostility having stemmed from their belief
                that the unity of India was their main achievement and their foremost contribution. The irony was that
                both the Hindus and the British had not anticipated the astonishingly tremendous response that the
                Pakistan demand had elicited from the Muslim masses. Above all, they failed to realize how a hundred
                million people had suddenly become supremely conscious of their distinct nationhood and their high
                destiny. In channeling the course of Muslim politics towards Pakistan, no less than in directing it
                towards its consummation in the establishment of Pakistan in 1947, none played a more decisive role than
                did Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It was his powerful advocacy of the case of Pakistan and his
                remarkable strategy in the delicate negotiations that followed the formulation of the Pakistan demand,
                particularly in the post-war period, that made Pakistan inevitable.</p>
            <h2>CRIPPS SCHEME</h2>
            <p>While the British reaction to the Pakistan demand came in the form of the Cripps offer of April, 1942,
                which conceded the principle of self-determination to provinces on a territorial basis, the Rajaji
                Formula (called after the eminent Congress leader C.Rajagopalacharia, which became the basis of
                prolonged Jinnah-Gandhi talks in September, 1944), represented the Congress alternative to Pakistan. The
                Cripps offer was rejected because it did not concede the Muslim demand the whole way, while the Rajaji
                Formula was found unacceptable since it offered a “moth-eaten, mutilated” Pakistan and the too appended
                with a plethora of pre-conditions which made its emergence in any shape remote, if not altogether
                impossible. Cabinet Mission, the most delicate as well as the most tortuous negotiations, however, took
                place during 1946-47, after the elections which showed that the country was sharply and somewhat evenly
                divided between two parties- the Congress and the League- and that the central issue in Indian politics
                was Pakistan.</p>
            <p>These negotiations began with the arrival, in March 1946, of a three-member British Cabinet Mission. The
                crucial task with which the Cabinet Mission was entrusted was that of devising in consultation with the
                various political parties, constitution-making machinery, and of setting up a popular interim
                government. But, because the Congress-League gulf could not be bridged, despite the Mission’s (and the
                Viceroy’s) prolonged efforts, the Mission had to make its own proposals in May, 1946. Known as the
                Cabinet Mission Plan, these proposals stipulated a limited centre, supreme only in foreign affairs,
                defense and communications and three autonomous groups of provinces. Two of these groups were to have
                Muslim majorities in the north-west and the north-east of the subcontinent, while the third one,
                comprising the Indian mainland, was to have a Hindu majority. A consummate statesman that he was, Jinnah
                saw his chance. He interpreted the clauses relating to a limited centre and the grouping as “the
                foundation of Pakistan”, and induced the Muslim League Council to accept the Plan in June 1946; and this
                he did much against the calculations of the Congress and to its utter dismay.</p>
            <p>Tragically though, the League’s acceptance was put down to its supposed weakness and the Congress put up
                a posture of defiance, designed to swamp the League into submitting to its dictates and its
                interpretations of the plan. Faced thus, what alternative had Jinnah and the League but to rescind their
                earlier acceptance, reiterate and reaffirm their original stance, and decide to launch direct action (if
                need be) to wrest Pakistan. The way Jinnah maneuvered to turn the tide of events at a time when all
                seemed lost indicated, above all, his masterly grasp of the situation and his adeptness at making
                strategic and tactical moves.</p>
            <h2>PARTITION PLAN</h2>
            <p>Partition Plan By the close of 1946, the communal riots had flared up to murderous heights, engulfing
                almost the entire subcontinent. The two peoples, it seemed, were engaged in a fight to the finish. The
                time for a peaceful transfer of power was fast running out. Realizing the gravity of the situation. His
                Majesty’s Government sent down to India a new Viceroy- Lord Mountbatten. His protracted negotiations
                with the various political leaders resulted in 3 June (1947) Plan by which the British decided to
                partition the subcontinent, and hand over power to two successor States on 15 August, 1947. The plan was
                duly accepted by the three Indian parties to the dispute- the Congress the League and the Akali Dal
                (representing the Sikhs).</p>
            <h2>LEADER OF A FREE NATION</h2>
            <p>In recognition of his singular contribution, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah was nominated by the Muslim
                League as the Governor-General of Pakistan, while the Congress appointed Mountbatten as India’s first
                Governor-General. Pakistan, it has been truly said, was born in virtual chaos. Indeed, few nations in
                the world have started on their career with less resources and in more treacherous circumstances. The
                new nation did not inherit a central government, a capital, an administrative core, or an organized
                defence force. The Punjab holocaust had left vast areas in a shambles with communications disrupted.
                This, alongwith the en masse migration of the Hindu and Sikh business and managerial classes, left the
                economy almost shattered.</p>
            <p>The treasury was empty, India having denied Pakistan the major share of its cash balances. On top of all
                this, the still unorganized nation was called upon to feed some eight million refugees who had fled the
                insecurities and barbarities of the north Indian plains that long, hot summer. If all this was
                symptomatic of Pakistan’s administrative and economic weakness, the Indian annexation, through military
                action in November 1947, of Junagadh (which had originally acceded to Pakistan) and the Kashmir war over
                the State’s accession (October 1947-December 1948) exposed her military weakness. In the circumstances,
                therefore, it was nothing short of a miracle that Pakistan survived at all. That it survived and forged
                ahead was mainly due to one man-Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The nation desperately needed a charismatic leader
                at that critical juncture in the nation’s history, and he fulfilled that need profoundly. After all, he
                was more than a mere Governor-General: he was the Quaid-i-Azam who had brought the State into being.</p>
            <p>In the ultimate analysis, his very presence at the helm of affairs was responsible for enabling the newly
                born nation to overcome the terrible crisis on the morrow of its cataclysmic birth. He mustered up the
                immense prestige and the unquestioning loyalty he commanded among the people to energize them, to raise
                their morale, to raise the profound feelings of patriotism that the freedom had generated, along
                constructive channels. Though tired and in poor health, Jinnah yet carried the heaviest part of the
                burden in that first crucial year. He laid down the policies of the new state, called attention to the
                immediate problems confronting the nation and told the members of the Constituent Assembly, the civil
                servants and the Armed Forces what to do and what the nation expected of them. He saw to it that law and
                order was maintained at all costs, despite the provocation that the large-scale riots in north India had
                provided. He moved from Karachi to Lahore for a while and supervised the immediate refugee problem in
                the Punjab. In a time of fierce excitement, he remained sober, cool and steady. He advised his excited
                audience in Lahore to concentrate on helping the refugees, to avoid retaliation, exercise restraint and
                protect the minorities. He assured the minorities of a fair deal, assuaged their inured sentiments, and
                gave them hope and comfort. He toured the various provinces, attended to their particular problems and
                instilled in the people a sense of belonging. He reversed the British policy in the North-West Frontier
                and ordered the withdrawal of the troops from the tribal territory of Waziristan, thereby making the
                Pathans feel themselves an integral part of Pakistan’s body-politics. He created a new Ministry of
                States and Frontier Regions, and assumed responsibility for ushering in a new era in Balochistan. He
                settled the controversial question of the states of Karachi, secured the accession of States, especially
                of Kalat which seemed problematical and carried on negotiations with Lord Mountbatten for the settlement
                of the Kashmir Issue.</p>
            <h2>THE QUAID’S LAST MESSAGE</h2>
            <p>It was, therefore, with a sense of supreme satisfaction at the fulfillment of his mission that Jinnah
                told the nation in his last message on 14 August, 1948: “The foundations of your State have been laid
                and it is now for you to build and build as quickly and as well as you can”. In accomplishing the task
                he had taken upon himself on the morrow of Pakistan’s birth, Jinnah had worked himself to death, but he
                had, to quote Richard Symons, “contributed more than any other man to Pakistan’s survival”. He died on
                11 September, 1948.</p>
            <p>A man such as Jinnah, who had fought for the inherent rights of his people all through his life and who
                had taken up the somewhat unconventional and the largely misinterpreted cause of Pakistan, was bound to
                generate violent opposition and excite implacable hostility and was likely to be largely misunderstood.
                But what is most remarkable about Jinnah is that he was the recipient of some of the greatest tributes
                paid to any one in modern times, some of them even from those who held a diametrically opposed
                viewpoint.</p>
            <p>The Aga Khan considered him “the greatest man he ever met”, Beverley Nichols, the author of `Verdict on
                India’, called him “the most important man in Asia”, and Dr. Kailashnath Katju, the West Bengal Governor
                in 1948, thought of him as “an outstanding figure of this century not only in India, but in the whole
                world”. While Abdul Rahman Azzam Pasha, Secretary General of the Arab League, called him “one of the
                greatest leaders in the Muslim world”, the Grand Mufti of Palestine considered his death as a “great
                loss” to the entire world of Islam. It was, however, given to Surat Chandra Bose, leader of the Forward
                Bloc wing of the Indian National Congress, to sum up succinctly his personal and political achievements.
                “Mr Jinnah” he said on his death in 1948, “was great as a lawyer, once great as a Congressman, great as
                a leader of Muslims, great as a world politician and diplomat, and greatest of all as a man of action.
                By Mr. Jinnah’s passing away, the world has lost one of the greatest statesmen and Pakistan its
                life-giver, philosopher and guide”. Such was Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the man and his mission,
                such the range of his accomplishments and achievements.</p>
