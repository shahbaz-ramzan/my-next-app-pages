//     <h3>Early Life and Education:</h3>
//     <p>Mohammed Ali Jinnah, revered as Quaid-e-Azam (meaning "Great Leader"), was born on December 25, 1876, in Karachi,
//         then part of British India. He belonged to a prosperous Gujarati family. His early education took place in
//         Karachi, and he later moved to England for higher studies.
//     </p>
//     <h3>Legal Career:</h3>
//     <p>Jinnah pursued law and became a successful barrister. He practiced law in Bombay, excelling in his field and
//         earning a reputation for his exceptional skills as a lawyer.
//     </p>
//     <h3>Political Journey:</h3>
//     <p>His political career began in the Indian National Congress, advocating for Hindu-Muslim unity. Over time, due to
//         ideological differences and the Congress's limited support for Muslim rights, he grew disillusioned and later
//         joined the All-India Muslim League in 1913.
//     </p>
//     <h3>Champion of Muslim Rights:</h3>
//     <p>Jinnah emerged as a vocal advocate for the rights of Muslims in British India. He envisioned a separate nation
//         for Muslims, advocating the "Two-Nation Theory," asserting that Muslims and Hindus were distinct nations with
//         separate identities.
//     </p>
//     <h3> Leader of Pakistan Movement:</h3>
//     <p>Quaid-e-Azam became the leader of the Pakistan Movement, tirelessly working towards the creation of a separate
//         homeland for Muslims. His advocacy and strategic negotiations led to the eventual formation of Pakistan on
//         August 14, 1947.
//     </p>
//     <h3>First Governor-General:</h3>
//     <p>Upon Pakistan's independence, Jinnah became its first Governor-General, steering the newly formed nation through
//         its initial challenges and laying the groundwork for its governance.
//     </p>
//     <h3>Legacy:</h3>
//     <p>Quaid-e-Azam’s leadership and determination played a pivotal role in the creation of Pakistan. His commitment to
//         democracy, equality, and religious freedom remains an integral part of Pakistan’s founding principles.
//     </p>
//     <h3>Demise:</h3>
//     <p>Sadly, Jinnah’s health declined rapidly after Pakistan’s independence. He passed away on September 11, 1948,
//         leaving behind a legacy of statesmanship, determination, and vision.
//     </p>
//     <h3>Conclusion:</h3>

//         resolve and vision transformed a dream into reality, providing a homeland for millions based on the principles
